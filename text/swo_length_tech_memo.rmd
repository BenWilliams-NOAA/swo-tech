# Abstract 

On the Alaska Fishery Science Center bottom trawl surveys length frequency data are collected and sex is subsequently determined from a subset of these collected data so that sex-specific length composition data are available for assessment of groundfish stocks. 
Determining sex from the length frequency data has resulted in acute and repetitive stress injuries of survey staff, and these injuries have become increasingly common. 
In December 2021, a working group was formed (the Survey Workflow Optimization working group) to evaluate the effect of reducing the amount of length frequency data for which sex is determined from historical levels in the bottom trawl surveys on length composition uncertainty. 
The working group developed a bootstrap-simulation approach that determined the amount of uncertainty gained by reducing the amount of length frequency data for which sex was subsequently determined over the spring of 2022. 
It was shown that the length composition input sample size was reduced by 25% or less compared to the input sample size for the full historical data sets for subsampling levels of 100 fish per haul for which sex was subsequently determined. 
Upon meeting with stock assessment authors the joint recommendation between the working group and assessment authors to the survey staff was to limit length frequency data for which sex is subsequently determined to 100 subsampled fish per haul.

# Introduction 

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has conducted effort-standardized bottom trawl surveys in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Aleutian Islands (AI) since 1982 [@Stauffer2004]. 
These resource surveys comprehensively catalog the biota encountered at each sampling station. Observations of sex-specific size distributions for each encountered species are collected by: 
(1) sorting the trawl sample by species, 
(2) weighing each species in aggregate, 
(3) obtaining a random subsample of target sample size; 
(4) sorting the length subsample by sex (each fish is cut with a scalpel, gonads identified and placed in a sex-specific receptacle), and (5) and measuring and recording each fish length (each fish is placed on a measuring board, length is identified and the species, sex and measurement are recorded into a computer). 
This length measurement process is repeated over 100,000 times in a given survey each year, representing a daunting amount of work for 6 field scientists per research vessel. 
Each year, this work flow results in acute and repetitive stress injuries, some requiring medical interventions and claims to the U.S. Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. 
Another consequence of the intensity of this work are unrecoverable errors in the observed data; as fatigue or injuries accumulate during the course of field work, so do data collection errors (e.g. failure to properly encode length measurements with the correct species or sex or incorrect identification of sex), despite extensive *in situ* quality assurance protocols.

In December of 2021, an AFSC working group was formed (the ‘Survey Workload Optimization’ working group, SWO) to evaluate the impacts of reducing sampling for sex within the length frequency data collections due to repetitive motion injuries that have been occurring on the bottom trawl surveys.
From the stock assessment perspective, the primary concern when reducing the sampling for sex within the length frequency data collections was the impact on the uncertainty in subsequent sex-specific length composition data. 
This is of particular importance to stock assessments that are sex-specific, such as the flatfish assessments conducted by AFSC. 
To that end, we evaluated the impact of reducing sampling for sex within the length frequency data collection to answer two questions: (1) what is the impact of reducing sampling for sex on the uncertainty in the sex-specific length composition?
And, (2) is there an acceptable level of increase in uncertainty in sex-specific length composition data due to subsampling for sex?

# Materials and Methods 
## Survey data 
Data collection for each AFSC groundfish survey is described in respective NOAA Technical Memorandum [EBS: @Lauth2019; AI: @vonSzalay2017; GOA: @vonSzalay2018].
Fundamental methods of length sample collection are generally synchronized between these surveys, with species-specific exceptions for minimum length subsample size. 
Survey protocols include sampling bimodal length distributions separately (e.g. many juveniles and fewer adults within one species), which are then extrapolated to the total estimated number of individuals in each length mode category for that trawl sample and aggregated. 
Some species’ gonads are difficult to successfully distinguish in the field, and a length threshold is determined (e.g. approximately 10-15 cm for walleye pollock) below which sex is coded as “unsexed”.


Survey length subsampling protocols have been altered at least once during the time series. 
Prior to an analysis of length frequency sample size [@Gerritsen2007], AFSC trawl survey standard operating procedures directed scientists to collect a minimum of 200 length specimens per species where more than 200 were in a trawl sample. 
In the EBS survey, the principles suggested by @Gerritsen2007, specify that 10 random length specimens should be sampled for each size bin range of a sample, have been applied to some species, although with varying consistency. 

The database (i.e., RACEBASE) was queried based on functions used in the sumfish package in Program R (https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/sumfish). 
Raw length sample data were summarized to determine the average number of sex-specific and total length frequency samples over the most recent three years by survey and species (EBS: 2017-2019; AI: 2014, 2016, 2018; GOA: 2017, 2019, 2021). 
Additionally we summarized the number of sex-specific lengths and total number of lengths collected per haul over time. 
The most frequently sampled species within each survey were then selected to be included in this analysis; these included primarily stocks that are assessed at AFSC with age structured assessment models, but also include stocks assessed solely with trawl survey biomass estimates. 

## Expanding length frequency to population abundance at length
Length frequency samples collected by the AFSC bottom trawl surveys are expanded by catch and stratum area to obtain estimates of population abundance at length. 
This is often referred to as the ‘first stage expansion’ and is a common method to obtain population estimates at length from area-swept survey data [e.g., @Ailloud2019]. 
Population abundance at length are computed for three sex categories: males, females, and unsexed at the stratum level, which are then summed across stratum to obtain the population abundance at length for the management-scale region (i.e., BS, AI, or GOA), these can also be summed to any sub-region level.

In the first step of this process we compute the overall population numbers in year-*y* within stratum-*st* ($\hat{N}_{st,y}$) with:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{st,y}=\overline{CPUE}_{st,y}\cdot A_{st}
  (\#eq:eqn1)
\end{equation}

where $A_{st}$ is the area of stratum-*st* (in km^2^), and $\overline{CPUE}_{st,y}$ is the average catch per unit effort of numbers captured across the hauls within a strata, given by:

\begin{equation}
 \overline{CPUE}_{st,y}
  =\frac{1}{H_{st,y}}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}CPUE_{h,st,y}
  =\frac{1}{H_{st,y}}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}\frac{n_{h,st,y}}{E_{h,st,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn2)
\end{equation}

where $H_{st,y}$ is the number of hauls, $CPUE_{h,st,y}$ is the catch per unit effort of numbers caught within a haul-*h*, $n_{h,st,y}$ is the catch (in numbers) in haul-*h*, and $E_{h,st,y}$ is the effort in haul-*h*, which is computed as the net width multiplied by the time on bottom, or, the area swept by the haul (in km^2^). 
Next, the ratio of catch per unit effort among hauls ($\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}$) is computed by:

\begin{equation}
\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}=\frac{CPUE_{h,st,y}}{\sum_{h=1}^{H_{sy,y}}CPUE_{h,st,y}}
  (\#eq:eqn3)
\end{equation}

where $CPUE_{h,st,y}$ is the catch per unit effort of numbers caught within a haul-*h*. We then compute the sex-specific ratio of the total number of lengths sampled within a haul by length ($\hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y}$) with:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y} = 
  \begin{cases}
    (1) \frac{N_{sx,l,h,st,y}}{N_{h,st,y}}  \\
    (2) \frac{\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}[N_{sx,l,h,st,y}/N_{h,st,y}]}{\sum_{sx=1}^{3}\sum_{l=1}^{L}\sum_{h=1}^{H_{st,y}}[N_{sx,l,h,st,y}/N_{h,st,y}]}
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:eqn4)
\end{equation}

where $N_{sx,l,h,st,y}$ is the length frequency sampled, in numbers, by sex-*sx* and length-*l*. 
In some cases there are hauls that have catch for a species but did not collect length frequency data, in this case (2) is applied in order to account for the unknown length frequency in these hauls, otherwise, if length frequency samples are obtained (1) is applied. 
Finally, we estimate the sex-specific population abundance at length within strata-st with:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{N}_{sx,l,st,y}=\hat{N}_{st,y}\cdot\hat{p}_{CPUE,h,st,y}\cdot\hat{p}_{sx,l,h,st,y}
  (\#eq:eqn5)
\end{equation}

and to obtain the sex-specific estimates of population abundance at length in a management area one would simply sum $\hat{N}_{sx,l,st,y}$ across strata.

## Bootstrap-simulation framework  
To evaluate the effect of sub-sampling length frequency collections for which sex is subsequently determined we developed a bootstrap-simulation framework that allowed for reductions in the number of sexed length frequencies collected.
We used the historical length frequency data that were collected from the bottom trawl surveys to evaluate the impact of reduced sex-specific length frequency data. 
In simple terms, the simulation framework that we developed would select a pre-determined number of fish from the length frequency collections that would then be subsequently sexed, the remaining length frequency data (regardless of whether sex was actually determined in the historical data) was classified as ‘unsexed’. 

The bootstrap-simulation framework is composed of a suite of nested resampling protocols. 
Bootstrap resampling was performed either with replacement (wr) or without replacement (wor) depending on the needs of a particular protocol. 
Functions to run the sampling protocols were developed in a compartmentalized manner to provide for substantial flexibility in exploring desired resampling protocols. 
The order of operations (Figure \@ref(fig:length)) has the following schedule, with steps 1-3 being optional switches:

1. Resample hauls (wr) from the set of hauls with associated catch per unit effort (in numbers) 
2. Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed lengths (wr)
3. From the resampled lengths in step 2, subset the lengths (wor) with observed sex (either male or female) and sample these sex-length pairs at the sub-sampling level determined in step 2; equation \@ref(eq:eqn6)
4. Calculate sex-specific population abundance at length, using equations \@ref(eq:eqn1) - \@ref(eq:eqn5)

The core of the bootstrap-simulation function (step 3 above) is designed to explore reductions in the sample size of lengths that are then sexed on a per haul basis. 
In this bootstrap-simulation, the number of lengths in a given haul must be less than or equal to the desired sample size *x* determined in step 2. In step 3, when the number of resampled lengths from step 2 in a haul $n_l$ is less than *x* then $n_l$ is used directly, if $n_l>x$ then a random draw of lengths is taken without replacement in step 3.

<!-- 1. reduce total number of length samples - wor  -->
<!-- 2. shuffle hauls - wr  -->
<!-- 3. shuffle lengths - wr  -->
<!-- 4. shuffle age data - wr -->
<!-- 5. resample lengths - wor  -->
<!-- 6. calculate length composition  -->
<!-- 7. calculate population abundance at length, using the results of step 6  -->
<!-- 8. calculate population abundance at age, using results of step 7 -->
<!-- 10. calculate effective samples size for ages and lengths, using results of step 7 and 8 -->

\begin{equation}
 l_{x} = 
  \begin{cases}
    n_l    & n_l\le x  \\
    n_{lx} & n_l > x, ~ wor
  \end{cases}
  (\#eq:eqn6)
\end{equation}

The bootstrap-simulation then repeated steps 1-3 iteratively for each sex sub-sample size determined in step 1, providing iterated sex-specific population abundance at length that was then compared to the historical sex-specific population abundance at length determined by the bottom trawl surveys.

We applied the bootstrap-simulation to species that were most commonly captured in the EBS, AI, and GOA bottom trawl surveys (Table \@ref(tab:tbl1)). 
The subsample levels for subsequent sex determination from the length frequency collections that we evaluated were 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175 samples. 
We also ran the bootstrap-simulation for the historical number of sexed length frequency collections without subsetting in order to compare the base level uncertainty to the increase in uncertainty gained through subsampling. 
We ran the bootstrap-simulation for 500 iterations, which was a level for which the variability in population abundance at length results had stabilized, and applied the bootstrap-simulation to the most recent 3 years of the respective bottom trawl surveys, which were the most indicative of the current sampling levels. 
The bootstrap-simulation was developed in R [@Rcore] and is available via GitHub as an R package (https://github.com/BenWilliams-NOAA/swo).

## Computing effective and input sample size
Effective sample size, as introduced by @Mcallister1997, is a statistic that can evaluate the level of intra-haul correlation in composition samples that are collected on a survey (whether from age or length frequency collections). 
It is also a statistic that can evaluate the amount of uncertainty in an estimated composition compared to an observed composition. 
Effective sample size is given by:

\begin{equation}
 ESS=\frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C}E_c(1-E_c)}{\sum_{c=1}^{C}(E_c-O_c)^2}
 (\#eq:eqn7)
\end{equation}

where $E_c$ is the estimated proportion for category-*c* (which can be either age or length or any other arbitrary category across which proportions are computed) and $O_c$ is the observed proportion.
 
In this bootstrap-simulation the underlying length composition derived from the historical bottom trawl surveys was treated as the observed proportions $O_c$ in equation \@ref(eq:eqn7). 
For each iteration of the bootstrap simulation for a determined sex sub-sample size we computed a sex-specific estimated proportion ($E_c$) that was then compared to the underlying historical sex-specific length composition (the effective sample size for the total length composition, as the sum of population abundance at length, was also computed). 
Thus, across each iteration of the bootstrap simulation we computed an effective sample size that indicated the amount of increased uncertainty that was caused by sub-sampling sexed length frequency data. 
To summarize the effective sample sizes across iterations we used the harmonic mean, which has been shown to reduce bias in recovering the true sample size in simulations for a multinomial distribution and due to this reduced bias, the harmonic mean has also been recommended to be used to determine the ‘input sample size’ that is then used in stock assessment models to fit compositional data [@Stewart2014]. 
Herein, when we use the term ‘effective sample size’ we are referring to the effective sample sizes that were computed for each iteration of the bootstrap simulation, when we use the term ‘input sample size’ we are referring to the harmonic mean of the iterated effective sample sizes.



# Results 

The species with the greatest average total number of lengths sampled varied by the regional-specific surveys (Table \@ref(tab:tbl1)). 
The top five species for the eastern Bering Sea shelf bottom trawl survey were walleye pollock, northern rock sole, yellowfin sole,  flathead sole, and arrowtooth flounder; Pacific ocean perch, northern rockfish, walleye pollock, arrowtooth flounder, and Atka mackerel for the Aleutian Islands bottom trawl survey; and arrowtooth flounder, Pacific ocean perch, walleye pollock, flathead sole, and rex sole for the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey. 
The species most frequently sampled for lengths across all the surveys was walleye pollock in the eastern Bering Sea survey, with *x* times as many samples as the next most frequently sampled species across all the surveys (arrowtooth flounder in the Gulf of Alaska).

The number of sampled lengths per haul for species of interest are summarized in (Figures \@ref(fig:ai-samples-per-haul) - \@ref(fig:goa-samples-per-haul)). 
All summarize the most recent *six* years of data. 
The species with the greatest number of hauls exceeding the sampling target of 200 samples are walleye pollock, yellowfin sole, and northern rock sole in the eastern Bering Sea; Pacific ocean perch, northrn rockfish, and walleye pollock in the Aleutian Islands; and Pacific ocean perch, arrowtooth flounder, and walleye pollock in the Gulf of Alaska. 
*maybe a note on ebs pollock compared to other species to set up for reasons behind different results*.

In general, for each region investigated the mean of the replicated sex-specific effective sample size for length composition increased as the number of collected lengths for which sex was determined increased (Figures \@ref(fig:ai-length) - \@ref(fig:goa-length-flats)). 
For a number of species, the subsampling case of 175 sexed lengths was nearly equivalent to the base case (in which non subsampling occurred), indicating that for these species around 175 or less lengths have been subsequently sexed historically.
There were notable exceptions to the subsampling case of 175 being similar to the base case, indicating that in the historical surveys there were a number of hauls in which more that 175 length collections were subsequently sexed. 
These exceptions include arrowtooth flounder in the Gulf of Alaska (\@ref(fig:goa-length-flats)) and eastern Bering Sea (\@ref(fig:bs-length)), and walleye pollock in the eastern Bering Sea (\@ref(fig:bs-length)), with the most extremem difference resulting for eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock. 
For all the species and regions investigated the mean of the replicated effective sample size for the total length composition (the sum of the female, male, and unsexed population at length estimates) were insensitive to the sexed subsampling cases. 

Results of the sex-specific input sample size for length composition also mimicked the results of the replicated effective sample size for each region; as the sexed subsampling level increased the input sample size increased (Figures \@ref(fig:ai-iss) - \@ref(fig:goa-iss-flats)). 
It was usually the case that the magnitude of input sample size was sensitive to the species and the survey year. 
In general, larger input sample sizes were associated with species with larger sample sizes. 
While, for any given species, the effect of the survey year on the input sample size is associated with the sample size for that year, it is also related to the structure of the length composition (i.e., uni- or multi-modal length compositions). 
Sex-specific input sample sizes for length frequency ranged from around 50 to 750 for the Aleutian Islands bottom trawl survey (Figure \@ref(fig:ai-iss)), 500 to 2,000 for the eastern Bering Sea bottom trawl survey (Figure \@ref(fig:bs-iss)), and *X* to *X* for the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey (Figures \@ref(fig:goa-iss) - \@ref(fig:goa-iss-flats)). 
Similar to the results of the replicated effective sample size, the input sample size for the total length composition remained stable across the sexed subsampling cases investigated. 
Total input sample size for length were species-specific, with values around 50 to 500 for less frequently sampled species and 1,000 to 3,500 for more frequently sampled species in the ALeutian Islands, eastern Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska.

Compared to the base input sample size, the proportion of the base input sample size for each sexed subsampling case was similar for females and males, but were different across species and survey years (Figures \@ref(fig:ai-iss-prop) - \@ref(fig:goa-iss-prop-flats)). 
The sex-specific proportion of base input sample size increased as the sexed subsample size increased, and for the smallest sexed subsampling case the sex-specific input sample size was less than 0.5 of the base input sample size for some species.
Again, the proportion of the base input sample size for the total length composition was relatively unchanged across the sexed subsampling cases. 
For a number of species and survey years the sex-specific proportion for the sexed subsampling cases were similar to the base input sample size, particularly for sexed subsampling sizes greater than 100. 
For these species, the proportion of the sexed subsample size of 100 was greater than 0.75 of the base input sample size. 
The most notable exception was for eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock in each year of the survey, whose proportion of the base input sample size for each of the sexed subsampling cases investigated ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 (Figure \@ref(fig:bs-iss-prop)). 
Other species for which input sample sizes for sexed subsample sizes greater than 100 were less than 0.75 of the base input sample size included eastern Bering Sea Pacific cod in 2019, eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands flathead sole in 2018, and eastern Bering Sea arrowtooth flounder in 2018 and 2019.
